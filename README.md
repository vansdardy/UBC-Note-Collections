# UBC Notes Collection

Entering university was not an easy transition. I have suffered anxiety back then, and I still do.

However, I have realized that periodically summarizing what I have learned in class is a fantastic way to both review for midterms and finals and enhance comprehension for these courses.

Thus, I initiated to put my notes together after writing them on an iPad (Yes, I take hand-written notes, just on an iPad) so that I can grasp the structure of the course contents which helps me to understand. Some of the notes are in LaTeX (for mathematics, for example), some of the notes are in Markdown (for computer science, for example. It is rather convenient for me to take notes through Markdown in many occasions), some of the notes are just handwritten (I probably did not organize them because I am lazy).

The life here is kinda crazy, so it is no doubt that I intend this project to be enjoyed by all people if they were of any help (hopefully they do). However, more importantly, it is a great opportunity for me, myself, to keep track of what I have done, and allow myself to use these notes whenever I want (especially away from a local machine).

To help both me and you to navigate, the table of contents is presented below. The format will be as follows:

- Year 4 (TBD)

In my 3rd school year, I had the opportunity to go on exchange to ETH Z\"urich for the first semester, hence the ECTS credits shown above. The German course was taken at the next door Universit\"at Z\"urich. However, I did get into a very bad mental state during the stay in Switzerland and after I returned to UBC. Luckily, at the time of writing this, I am doing better already. Thus, you may notice a lack of organized notes for this year's content except for the quantum physics course. That one, I really put a lot of effort, and should be preserved here. I am, however, going to slowly (I mean probably years) put together the notes for my ETHZ exchange, because they really are good courses, but I have yet been unable to understand them to a level up to which I can organize the notes. So, wish me luck.

This list and course notes will update after each term ends (around December, April, and August).
