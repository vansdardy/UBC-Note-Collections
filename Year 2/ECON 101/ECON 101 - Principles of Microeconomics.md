# <center>ECON 101 - Principles of Microeconomics</center>

## Economic Principles

1. Scarcity Principle: Stuff is scarce
2. Choice Principle: People make decisions as tradeoffs
3. Opportunity Cost Principle: The cost of something is what you give up to get it
4. Increasing Opportunity Cost Principle: Rational producers use the lowest OC input first
5. Coordination Principle: Free markets automatically coordinate
6. Efficiency Principle: Efficiency is better than inefficiency
7. Maximization Principle: Individuals prefer happiness over unhappiness
8. Cost-benefit (Marginal) Principle: Take action when marginal benefits exceed extra costs
9. Specialization Principle: Specialization of labor requires trade and markets
10. Comparative Advantage Principle: Trade may lead to gains from trade
11. Intervention Principle: Sometimes government may improve on market outcomes
12. Equilibrium Principle: If you are there, you will stay there; Remains constant over time
13. Stability Principle: If you are not there, you will go there

## Chapter 1: Economics Concepts and Issues

1. What is economics

	Economics is the study of the **management** of **scarce resources** to **satisfy unlimited wants **(how to make decisions, how to choose)

	- Resources

		- Input = Factors of production = **Resources**

			Output = **Goods and Services**

		- Production (process): transforming inputs into outputs

		- Consumption (process): satisfying human wants with outputs

		- Five factors of production
			- Capital
				- Land
				- Labor
				- Technology
				- Entrepreneurship

	- Scarcity

		- Limited, bounded, inadequate ($Q_d > Q_s$, when $P = 0$)
		- Inputs $\to$ Outputs are **limited**; Wants are **unlimited**
		- Economics: manages these factors; Politics: decides among the unlimited desires
		- Scarce good vs. Free good

	- Choice

		- Scarcity implies choice, made by evaluating costs

	- Opportunity Cost (Benefits that are LOST)

		- **Value/benefit** of the **next-best** forgone alternative;

			value of **what is given up** to have the item;

			a ratio;

			**What would have been had?**

		- Four elements

			- Value: subjective - a **benefit**
			- Next-best: what would have been chosen
			- Foregone: what is given up
			- Alternative: choice

		- Only include costs affected by the choice: excludes **sunk cost** (cost incurred in past that cannot be recovered, thus irrelevant)

		- Do "A" until marginal cost of "A" $=$ marginal benefit of "A"

	- Production Possibility Curve

		- Shows **all possible** combinations of **production**, if **all** inputs are **fully and efficiently** employed
		- **Law of Increasing Marginal Opportunity Cost**: Opportunity cost of producing "A" increases as more "A"s are produced
		- Scarcity: Right of Line
			- Point on line - inputs fully and efficiently employed - maximum output
			- Point under the curve - inputs underused and inefficiently used
		- Choice: Negative slope
			- Cannot produce more of both
			- Cannot produce more of one without less of the other
		- OC: Value of slope
		- Efficiency: Shift of PPC
			- Shifts right: same input, more output
		- The most efficient factors are used first and the most inefficient factors are switched out first
		- Increase productivity $\to$ Increase efficiency $\to$ Shift PPC to the right (outward)
		- Where to be on PPC?
			- Marginal Cost $=$ Marginal Benefit

	- 4 economics problems

		- Microeconomics
			- Production - What is produced and by whom? - Allocation of resources
			- Consumption - What is consumed and by whom? - Distribution of income
		- Macroeconomics
			- Idle capacity - Why is the economy below PPC?
			- Increase capacity - How to shift PPC outwards?

	- Government policy

		- Shape allocation of resources to correct market failures (efficiency)
		- Address distribution of income to correct fairness (equity)
		- Unemployment and inflation (output gaps)
		- Economic growth (increase capacity)

2. Complexity of the modern economy

	- Nature of market economies
		- Self-organizing economy
			- Spontaneous economic order
			- Self-organizing
			- Wealth of Nations - invisible hand
		- Efficiency
			- Free markets: relatively efficient
			- Efficiency: Sellers produce what buyers want at the least cost
			- Coordinate through **price**
			- May fail (efficiency) or be unfair (equity)
		- Incentives
			- Incentives Principle: rational decision makers respond to incentives
			- Rational Self-interest Principle: rational decision makers take actions that decrease their individual costs and increase their individual benefits
			- Markets governed by "rules of the game"
				- Government, institution, rule of law, contract...
	- Decision makers
		- Households
			- consistent actions
			- maximize satisfaction
			- input (labor) $\leftrightarrow$ income
			- spend income on goods and services
		- Firms
			- consistent actions
			- maximize profits
			- output $\leftrightarrow$ income
			- spend income on factors of production
		- Governments
			- Do not act consistently
			- May not maximize anything
		- Rest of the world
			- act like rational consumers and producers
	- Circular Flow of Income
		- Spendthrift economy: excessive spending, lack of saving
		- Frugal economy: spend money wisely, save money for future uses
		- Governed economy: regulated by government body
		- Open economy: other countries engage in trade of products
		- Injections: Exports, Government expenditure, Bank investments
		- Leaks (Withdrawals): Imports, Taxes, Savings
	- Production and Trade
		- Specialization of labor: one product/service produced/provided by one **specialized** worker
		- Division of labor: One product **divided** into individual tasks, each done by different workers
		- Specialize/Division $\to$ Efficiency $\to$ Trade $\to$ Markets
		- Everyone wins when individuals specialize in doing something in which they have a **comparative advantage **(being able to produce a product a lower opportunity cost)
	- Globalization
		- Advancements in transportation and communication
		- Increased **international trade**, increased **world GDP per capita**

3. Alternative to the market economy

	- Types of economic systems

		- Traditional
			- based on tradition
			- unchanging environment
			- feudal system
		- Command
			- central planning authority
			- requires **forecasting** - difficult
			- 5-year plans
		- Free
			- private households and firms
			- decentralized decisions
			- price system to coordinate sellers and buyers
		- Mixed
			- private and public sectors
			- spectrum

	- Free vs. Command

		- Adam Smith: efficiency and allocation of resources;

			Karl Marx: equity and distribution of incomes

		- Command: may be good for **transition** from traditional economies

		- Market: difficulties with **market failures** and **equity**

		- Mixed: may trump Command and Free?

		- Efficient allocation $\ne$ Equitable distribution

		- Free economy $\ne$ Democratic politics

		- Failure of central planning

			- misplaced incentives
			- failure of coordination
			- failure of quality control
			- environmental degradation

	- Economics integrate with other social sciences

		- Political science, psychology, sociology, history, philosophy, law

	- Government in a mixed economy

		- Market: voluntary transactions + free choice
		- Government: enforcing legal system to reinforce the economic system
			- Private property; Freedom to contract
		- Deals with market failures
			- Monopolies
			- Externalities (pollution)
			- Public goods (Army)
			- Asymmetrical information (Insurance)
			- Merit goods

## Chapter 2: Economic Theories

1. Positive vs. Normative

	- Distinction
		- Positive: objective and testable
		- Normative: value judgement
	- Reasons of economists disagreeing with each other
		- different definitions, assumptions, values
		- short run vs. long run perspective (the savings paradox)

2. Building and Testing theories

	- Theories

		- General concepts

			- The Law of Large Numbers: random movements of individuals offset one another

				Group behavior easier to predict than individual behavior

			- **AS IF** test: Individuals acts **as if** the goal is to maximize happiness

			- Theory - Model

				- Explains **why** a relationship exists
				- Testable
				- Can ONLY be **disproven**, not proven

		- Components

			- Variables
				- Endogenous variables (dependent/induced variables)
				- Exogenous variables (independent/autonomous variables)
			- Assumptions (Definition, Behavior, Condition)
				- Motives: psychological
				- Causation: one factor causes the other
			- Predictions/Hypotheses
				- Propositions that can be **logically inferred** from assumptions
				- if - then: cause and effect
			- "For the reason that..., it follows that..."

	- Testing

		- Rejection vs. Confirmation
			- Refutation test: can the theory be **refuted** by evidence
			- Confirmation test: yield inconclusive results by evidences **confirming** the hypothesis
		- Statistical analysis
			- statistical methods - randomized control trials
		- Correlation vs. causation
			- Correlation: 2 variables move together
			- Causation: reasoning

3. Economic data

	- Index numbers

		- Compare two time series with **different units of measurement** and "absolute values"

			Compare **relative** changes rather than **absolute**

		- CPI = weighted average of representative basket of consumer goods

		- **Base year** = unity; Ratios to solve

	- Graphing Economic Data

		- Cross-sectional data: observations made at the **same time** across **different units**
		- Time series data: observations made **across time** for the **same unit**
		- Scatter diagram: observations for pairs of variables

## Chapter 3: Demand and Supply

1. Theory of Demand
	- Definition of quantity demanded
		- Quantity **household** **wants** to purchase, **given** the own price, **ceteris paribus**
		- Flow variable (over time) vs. Stock variable (Point in time)
	- Slope of Demand curve
		- Inverse/negative relationship between $P$ and $Q_d$
		- Curve convex to origin
		- Marginal: Incentive $=$ Benefit - Cost
	- $Q_d = f(P)$, ceteris paribus
	- Shifts in Demand
		- Ceteris paribus variables
			- Income
				- Normal - Income increases, $Q_d$ increase
				- Inferior - Income increases, $Q_d$ decrease
			- Taste
			- Advertisement
			- Related good
				- Complement: used jointly
					- Honey and beeswax: $P(Honey)$ increases, $Q_{Honey}$ decreases, $Q_{beeswax}$ decreases while $P(beeswax)$ stay the same $\to$ Demand of beeswax shifts to the left
				- Substitute: used alternatively
					- Pepsi and CocaCola: $P(Pepsi)$ increases, $Q_{Pepsi}$ decreases, $Q_{CocaCola}$ increases while $P(CocaCola)$ stay the same $\to$ Demand of CocaCola shifts to the right
			- Expectations
		- $\Delta P \to \Delta Q_d$: moves along the curve; Change in ceteris paribus: shifts
2. Theory of Supply
	- Definition of Quantity supplied
		- Quantity the **firm wants** to sell, given the **own price**, **ceteris paribus**
		- Flow variable
	- Slope of Supply
		- Direct/Positive relationship between $P$ and $Q_s$
		- Curve, convex to origin
		- Marginal Incentive = Benefit - OC
	- $Q_s = f(P)$, ceteris paribus
	- Shifts of Supply (Move-along vs. Shift)
		- Input Price
		- Technology
		- Taxes/subsidies
		- $P$ of related good
			- Complement
				- $P_{oil} \downarrow \to Q_{oil} \downarrow \to Q_{gas} \downarrow$, $P_{gas}$ stays the same, supply curve of gas shifts left
			- Substitute
				- $P_{wheat} \downarrow \to Q_{wheat} \downarrow \to Q_{corn} \uparrow$, $P_{corn}$ stays the same, supply curve of corn shifts right
		- Expectations
		- Ultimately, most variables affect **Costs**: inverse relationship
			- For the same price, if costs decreases, $Q_s \uparrow$, shifts to the right; if cost increases, $Q_s \downarrow$, shifts to the left
3. Equilibrium
	- Desired $Q$: $Q_d$, $Q_s$ can be different
	- $Q_{exchanged}$: small number rule
	- $Q_e$ is reached when $Q_s = Q_d$.
	- Stability
		- Equilibrium: Demand $=$ Supply
		- Equilibrium Price: $P$ at $Q_d = Q_s$
		- Disequilibrium: Demand $\ne$ Supply
		- Disequilibrium Price: any $P$ for $Q_d \ne Q_s$
		- Excess demand: $Q_d > Q_s$
		- Excess supply: $Qd < Q_s$
		- $P \to P_e$
	- Laws of Supply and Demand
		- Shift Demand and Supply curves will yield different $P_e$ and $Q_e$ depending on what is being shifted
		- Shifts: superimpose different times on same graph
		- What matters: Relative Price (in terms of another good: ratio of absolute prices) > Absolute Price (in terms of money)

## Chapter 4: Elasticity

1. Price elasticity of demand

	- Measurement
		$$
		P_{\eta_{D}} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}
		\\
		=\frac{\frac{Q_2 - Q_1}{\frac{Q_2 + Q_1}{2}}}{\frac{P_2 - P_1}{\frac{P_2 + P_1}{2}}}
		$$

	- Inelastic: $Q_d$ irresponsive to $P$ change, $-1 < \epsilon = P_{\eta_D} < 0$

	- Elastic: $Q_d$ responsive to $P$ change, $\epsilon = P_{\eta_D} < -1$

	- Position + Inclination

		- Same inclination, Demand curves shifts to the right, $\frac{P}{Q}$ decreases, elasticity decreases in absolute value $\to$ More inelastic
		- Same position, steeper inclination $\to$ $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}$ decreases in absolute value $\to$ elasticity decreases, more inelastic

	- Terminology

		- $\epsilon = 0$: perfectly inelastic, quantity demanded does NOT respond to price change; vertical line
		- $|\epsilon| < 1$: inelastic, $Q_d$ irresponsive to $P$ change, steep negative slope
		- $|\epsilon| = 1$: unitary elastic, relative $\Delta Q_d =$ relative $\Delta P$, hyperbola
		- $|\epsilon| > 1$: elastic, $Q_d$ responsive to $P$ change, flat negative slope
		- $\epsilon = -\infty$: perfectly elastic, $P$ does not change with $Q_d$, horizontal line

	- Factors affecting Price elasticity of Demand

		- affected by **Availability of Substitutes of Outputs**
		- More/better substitutes of outputs, more elastic
		- The larger the set, the more inelastic the set is
		- More expensive items tend to have higher elasticity
		- Effect of time
			- In the long run, new substitutes are produced for **competition**, demand curve becomes more elastic
		- Type of Goods
			- Luxury: usually elastic
			- Necessity: usually inelastic

	- Elasticity and total revenue

		- Total revenue $= P_{exchanged} \times Q_{exchanged}$
		- Elastic demand curve
			- Total revenue $\uparrow$ as $P \downarrow$
		- Inelastic demand curve
			- Total revenue $\downarrow$ as $P \downarrow$

	- Elasticity along straight line demand

		- $\epsilon = $ position $\times$ inclination
		- When inclination remains the same for the straight demand curve, only position matters
		- When moving down the straight line, elasticity decreases, more and more inelastic
		- Along a straight line demand, total revenue is maximized when $\epsilon = -1$

2. Price elasticity of supply

	- Measurement: same formula, but for supply curves
	- Terminology
		- $\epsilon = 0$: perfectly inelastic, quantity demanded does NOT respond to price change; vertical line
		- $\epsilon < 1$: inelastic, $Q_d$ irresponsive to $P$ change, steep negative slope
		- $ epsilon = 1$: unitary elastic, relative $\Delta Q_d =$ relative $\Delta P$, hyperbola
		- $\epsilon > 1$: elastic, $Q_d$ responsive to $P$ change, flat negative slope
		- $\epsilon = \infty$: perfectly elastic, $P$ does not change with $Q_d$, horizontal line
	- Factors affect price elasticity of supply
		- affected by **Availability of Substitutes of Inputs**
		- More/better substitutes of inputs, more elastic
		- Availability of factors of production $\leftrightarrow$ Costs
			- **Fungible** factors of production (elastic): Output $P_{wheat} \uparrow$, if it is cheaper to acquire more inputs from the production of **oats**, producer will increase output greatly
			- **Non-interchangeable** factors of production (inelastic): Output $P_{wheat} \uparrow$, if it is expensive to acquire more inputs from the production of **cranberries**, producer will **NOT** increase output very much
		- Costs
			- Increase slowly as $Q_s$ increase, elastic
			- Increase rapidly as $Q_s$ increase, inelastic
		- Time
			- More elastic in long run because "higher production efficiency keeps costs down"

3. Elasticity and Taxation

	- Excise tax: consumption/sales/indirect tax on specific good
	- Tax incidence: who ultimately pays the tax
		- $= P_c - P_s$
		- Above $P_e$: Taxation on consumer
		- Below $P_e$: Taxation on producer

4. Income elasticity on demand

	- $$
		Y_{\eta_D} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}}
		$$

	- Responsiveness of $Q_d$ to a change in **income**

	- Categories

		- Normal luxury (superior): $\epsilon > 1$, income elastic
		- Normal necessity (normal): $\epsilon < 1$, income inelastic
		- Inferior (abnormal): $\epsilon < 0$, more income, less willingness to consume

	- Factors

		- Characteristic
			- Necessity: inelastic
			- Luxury: elastic
		- Income
			- As income rises, shifts from necessity to luxury

5. Cross-elasticity of Demand

	- Measurement

		- $$
			P_{\eta_{XY}} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q_X}{Q_X}}{\frac{\Delta P_Y}{P_Y}}
			$$

		- responsiveness of $Q_d$ of X to a change in the $P$ of good Y, *ceteris paribus*

		- $\epsilon < 0$: X and Y are complements

		- $\epsilon > 0$: X and Y are substitutes

## Chapter 5: Price Controls & Market Efficiency

1. Interaction among markets

	- Spillovers and Feedbacks
		- Oil production technology $\uparrow$
			- Oil market: Costs $\downarrow$, increase in $S$, drop in $P$
			- **Spillover** into labor: increase in Demand for inputs, increase in Price for inputs
			- **Feedback** in the Oil market: Costs increase, drop in $S$, increase in $P$
	- General Equilibrium = analysis of **all** markets **simultaneously**, market interact with **spillovers or feedbacks**
	- Partial equilibrium = analysis of ONE market (static analysis - at a point in time), assuming no feedbacks, for relatively small markets

2. Government controlled prices

	- Disequilibrium price
		- $Q_{exchanged} = \min (Q_d, Q_s)$
	- Price floors
		- Above $P_e$
			- minimum price at which the product cannot be sold below
			- excess supply $\to$ unemployment, "stockpiling"
				- Winners (sellers who sell $Q_d$) and losers (buyers, sellers who have excess supply)
		- Below $P_e$: ineffectual
		- Example: Minimum wage for labor market
	- Price ceilings
		- Above $P_e$: ineffectual
		- Below $P_e$
			- maximum price at which the product cannot be sold above
			- excess demand $\to$ labor shortage, "dumping"
				- Winners (buyers who buy $Q_s$) and losers (sellers, buyers who have excess demand)
		- Methods of allocating shortage of supply
			- First come, first served
			- Seller's preferences
			- Rationing
			- Black markets
		- Black market
			- products sold at price that violates legal price control
			- If $P_2 > P_e > P_1$ for $Q_s = Q_{exchanged}$, then black marketeers buys at $P_1$, sells at $P_2$ (on black market), and reaps profit of $(P_2 - P_1) \times Q_s$
		- Example: Rent control for housing market

3. Market/Allocative efficiency

	- Demand is the **maximum price** consumer is **willing** to pay;

		Supply is the **minimum price** producer is **willing** to accept;

		for a certain $Q$

	- Decreasing Marginal Benefit +  Increasing Marginal Cost

	- Economic surplus

		- Cooperative surplus, total surplus, net benefit to society
		- Benefit to consumers $-$ Cost to producers
		- Market efficiency is maximizing economic surplus
			- Free market can reach market-clearing equilibrium
			- Demand $=$ Supply
			- Perfect competition

	- Price control

		- DWSL - dead weight social loss: reduction of total surplus $\to$ market inefficiency

			Redistribution happens

		- Price ceiling, price floor, quota (quantity ceiling)

		- Reduces surplus, redistributes surplus
