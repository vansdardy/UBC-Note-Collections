# <center>ECON 102 - Macroeconomics</center>

## Chapter 6: Macroeconomics - The Big Picture

Keynesian economists claim: macroeconomics is not simply the aggregate of microeconomics, more tools are needed for analysis.

### Macro vs. Micro

- Microeconomics: Behavior of *individual* action (consumer, producer, government action in single markets)
- Macroeconomics: Behavior of the total market
	- Unemployment, total # of jobs
	- Growth in economic activities
	- Average price level
	- Currency value

### Microeconomics tools lack adequacy

- Multiplier effect: initial action $\to$ infinite loop of events
- Paradox of thrift: individuals acting in their best interest may not benefit the society as a whole

### Macroeconomics theory and policy

- Classical: Self-regulation
- Keynesian (after the Great Depression): Reduce pain and suffering through government policies
	- Monetary: Central bank adjusting key interest rate
	- Fiscal: Government adopting new tax policy
	- By comparing 1929 and 2008, the length of recession is reduced, this suggests that Keynesian theory is effective

During the Great Depression (1929), the highest unemployment rate is about **20%**, the worst deflation rate is about **-10%**.

### The Business Cycle

- Overall economic activities do not change smoothly, expansionary phases are usually larger than recessionary phases, but the temporary nose dive still poses problems
- There is a tendency to alternate between these two phases.
- Both phases can be problems because:
	- Job loss + Unemployment $\uparrow$
	- Too rapid or prolonged growth means the economy is in a bubble

### Long Run Economic Growth / Capacity Growth (Real GDP)

- This is driven by increasing consumption possibilities.

- We use real GDP (actual quantity of products) to measure growth because nominal GDP includes overestimation with inflation

- Growth accounting

	- The reason for LREG is different from the reason for BC
	- Measures the growth of *potential output* over a long time
	- Per-capita GDP % $\uparrow$: indicates an improvement in standard of living in long run

- Calculation

	- $$
		rGDPpc = \frac{rGDP}{population}
		$$

	- Potential output is calculated with $A(1+g)^t = B$

		- $A$: current output
		- $g$: growth rate
		- $t$: time
		- $B$: projected output

### Inflation, Disinflation and Deflation

- Inflation: Overall price level $\uparrow$

	Deflation: Overall price level $\downarrow$

- Disinflation: Average price level rises at a **slower rate** than before

- Use aggregate price level to account for many things in general

- Factors of inflation include:

	- Short run: level of economic activities $\leftrightarrow$ potential output
	- Long run: $Q_{money}$ in the economy

- Consequences of inflation

	- Some inflation (2% to 4%) incentivizes growth
	- High inflation disrupts economy and is chaotic, may lead to hyperinflation

### International Imbalance

- Trade balance = export - import
	- $> 0$: surplus
	- $< 0$: deficit
- It means it is an open economy
- Trade deficit does NOT mean a bad thing, trade surplus does NOT mean a good thing (Greece)

## Chapter 7: GDP and CPI

### GDP and Circular Flow of Income

- Why measure GDP?
	- Ignorant to economic situations during Great Depression
	- Use precise numeric values to represent total economic activities
	- Reasons
		- Compare standard of living over time
		- Compare difference of standard of living between 2 countries
- Definition of GDP
	- <u>Market value</u> of all <u>**final** goods and services</u> produced <u>within boundary of an economy</u> in a <u>specific period of time</u>
- Report GDP periodically
	- Flow variable (cannot be instantaneous): GDP
	- Stock variable (can be instantaneous): Population, capital
- Circular Flow of Income
	- ![1: The circular flow of income model â€ž Households: Provide labour to... |  Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313786588/figure/fig1/AS:462419265888256@1487260752476/The-circular-flow-of-income-model-Households-Provide-labour-to-businesses-in-return.png)
	- There are leakages and injections in the flow, but input = output

### Measurement of GDP

- Value added
	- $GDP = \sum value_{added}$
	- This is to avoid double counting, as we want the **final** product
- Expenditure approach
	- $GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)$
	- $C$: Household consumption - purchases by **domestic** firms
		- Only new product are counted
		- Newly-build home are not counted as consumption (counted as investment)
	- $I$: investment
		- Plants and equipment
		- (non) residential structures
		- Inventory adjustment
	- $G$: government spending
		- Government's direct purchase of goods and services
		- Transfer payments are not included
	- $(X - M)$: net export = export - import
- Income approach
	- $GDP = $ income earned by all households + non-factor payments
	- Income earned by all households
		- Wage
		- Interest
		- Rent
		- Dividends
	- Non-factor payments
		- Indirect tax
		- Depreciation
	- By StatsCAN: $GDP = $ compensation of employees +  gross operating surplus + gross mixed income + taxes - subsidies

### Real vs. Nominal GDP

- Nominal GDP: measured based on current prices
	- Nominal GDP can $\uparrow$ even if $Q_{produced}$ $\rightarrow$, or $\downarrow$ due to $\Delta P$
- Real GDP: adjusted for $\Delta P$
	- Indicates the aggregate output in $Q$
	- Select a base year to calculate total value of final products and services
	- $rGDP = \sum Q_{new} \times P_{base}$
- Chained Dollar real GDP: used because if we select different base year, we have a small difference in growth rate
	- Consider 2018, 2019 and 2020, to calculate 2020 real GDP, we:
		- Find 2018-2019 growth rate, based on 2018
		- Find 2018-2019 growth rate, based on 2019
		- Take average
		- Find 2019-2020 growth rate, based on 2019
		- Find 2019-2020 growth rate, based on 2020
		- Take average
		- $rGDP_{2020} = GDP_{2018} \times g_{18/19} \times g_{19/20}$

### Real GDP per capita

- An increase in real GDP per capita usually indicates an improvement in standard of living, not an increase in real GDP itself

- If %rGDP > %population on average, then the standard of living improves

- $$
	\%rGDPpc \approx \%rGDP - \%population
	$$

### GDP and meaning of life

- Rich is better: well-being(rich) > well-being(poor)
- Money means less as richer: average gain in utility per extra dollar decreases
- Money isn't everything: Middle-income are happier than rich

### Measuring inflation with aggregate price level

- Cost of living

	- $\sum_{i=1}^n P_iQ_i$
	- Choose a market basket $\{\bar{Q_1}, \dots, \bar{Q_n}\}$: this determines how much is spent on a fixed consumption bundle

- Consumer Price Index

	- Used to monitor cost of living

	- Based on consumer expenditure survey every $4$ years (StatsCAN decides on the items and quantities to represent an typical average urban household's consumption behaviour)

	- Monthly price survey $\to$ collect price data

	- Difference between PI and CPI, PI works with a market basket, but CPI works with a **fixed market basket**

	- $$
		CPI = \frac{C_{given}}{C_{base}} \times 100
		$$

- Inflation

	- $$
		Inflation = \frac{PI_2 - PI_1}{PI_1} \times 100\%
		$$

- Industry Producer Price Index

	- Monitors prices of goods bought by producers
	- Measures inflation based on commodity prices
	- Usually an early indicator

- GDP deflator

	- $$
		\frac{nominal}{real} \times 100\%
		$$

- Usually fluctuation-wise, $IPPI > CPI > Deflator$

## Chapter 8: Unemployment and Inflation

### Defining Unemployment Rate

- $$
	\%employment = \frac{employed}{working-age} \times 100\%
	$$

- Labor force

	- Has part-time/full-time job
	- Not employed, but looked for jobs within the last $4$ months
	- Available to work

- %Labor force participation = $\frac{labor-force}{work-age} \times 100\%$

- %Unemployment = $\frac{unemployed}{labor-force} \times 100\%$

- Working age = Labor + Non-Labor = (Employed + Unemployed) + Non-Labor

### Labor underutilization

- Possible overestimation: voluntarily unemployed
- Underestimations
	- Discouraged worker (People who stopped looking for work after 4 weeks)
	- Marginally attached worker: Hopeful of being reemployed (laid off, waiting to be recalled)
	- Underemployment
		- Invisibly underemployed: Not happy with current job
		- Visibly underemployed: Have a part-time job, but wants a full-time job

### Categories of Unemployment

- Frictional: e.g. due to job search
	- Churning: some people become unemployed constantly
	- Voluntary vs. Involuntary unemployment
	- Job search takes time
	- Detecting the size
		- Period of low unemployment $\to$ Short average waiting period $\to$ mainly frictional
	- Long run: Unemployed for $27$ weeks+
- Structural: e.g. due to structural change in the economy
	- Number of job seekers > Number of positions (surplus in labor): Structural / Cyclic
	- Factors
		- Minimum wages, Unions, Efficiency wages, Government policies
		- Creative destruction
- Cyclical
	- Caused by business cycle downturn
	- The economy has the capacity but not enough demand for output
- The natural rate of unemployment includes: Frictional + Structural
- Change in natural rate of unemployment
	- $\Delta$ labor force characteristics
	- $\Delta$ labor market institutions (technological innovations)
	- $\Delta$ government policies

### Cost of Inflation

- Real wage = $\frac{Nominal-wage}{Price-index}$
- Hyperinflation: 50% inflation per month
- Shoe-leather costs
	- Costs of transactions, avoids holding money
	- There may be employments that may not need without hyperinflation (bank hiring more people to process more money)
- Menu costs
	- Cost of changing listed price
- Unit-of-account costs
	- When money is less reliable
	- Calculations (relevant economic indices) are harder when inflation is high

### Winners and Losers in Inflation

- Interest rate

	- Return a lender receives after lending out for some time
	- Real interest rate $\leftrightarrow$ Nominal interest rate

- Fisher Equation

	- $r \approx i - \pi$
	- $r$: real interest rate
	- $i$: nominal interest rate
	- $\pi$: inflation

- When actual inflation > expected inflation, borrowers win (they pay less in purchasing power)

	When actual inflation < expected inflation, lenders win (they receive more in purchasing power)

- Disinflation is hard, as it requires a temporary but large increase in %unemployment

## Chapter 9: Long-run Economic Growth

### Benefit and Cost of Economic Growth

- Benefit: Improvement in standard of living
- Cost: Environmental pollution
- Kuznet's curve: environment eventually improves
- Measure economic growth by rGDPpc

### Rule of 70

- Output doubling time of an economy = $\frac{70}{g}$
	- $g$: annual growth rate

### Sources of Growth

- The most important factor so far: productivity

	- $$
		\frac{T_{output}}{T_{hour}}
		$$

- Average hour per worker

	- $$
		\frac{T_{hour}}{T_{employment}}
		$$

- EPR

	- $$
		\frac{T_{employment}}{Population}
		$$

- Thus, rGDP = Productivity $\times$ Average Hour $\times$ EPR

- %rGDP = %Productivity + %Average Hour + %EPR

- Factors of economic growth

	- Physical capital $\uparrow$
	- Human capital $\uparrow$ (better quality, skills)
	- Technological progress $\uparrow$

### Production Function

- A description/method of turning factors of production into output

- $$
	Y = A \times F(K, L, H)
	$$

	- $Y$: aggregate output
	- $L$: labor
	- $H$: human capital
	- $K$: physical capital
	- $A$: total factor productivity (determined by technology)

- Marginal Productivity

	- $\pdv{Y}{K}, \pdv{Y}{L}, \pdv{Y}{H}$

- Constant Returns to Scale

	- $2Y = A \times F(2K, 2L, 2H)$

- Assume constant returns to scale (LRAC)

	- $\frac{Y}{L} = A \times F(\frac{K}{L}, \frac{L}{L}, \frac{H}{L})$

	- We then have the Cobb-Douglas production function

	- $$
		y = A \times f(\frac{K}{L}, \frac{H}{L})
		$$

### Why grow rates differ?

- Different savings and investment spending
- Different education
- Different research and development

## Chapter 10: Savings, Investments, and the Financial System

### Some constants

- $Y_D$: disposable income

- $S_{private}$: private savings
	- $Y_D - C$
- $S_{public}$: public savings
	- $T - TR -G$
- $T$: tax
- $TR$: transfer payment
- $NFI$: net foreign investment
	- Capital outflow - Capital inflow
	- $NX$
- $S_{dom}^D$: domestic savings, domestic use; $S_{for}^D$: domestic savings, foreign use; etc

### Closed Economy (Without Government)

- $GDP = C + I = Y_D = C + S_{private} = Y = C + S_{national}$
- $S_{national} = S_{public} = I$

### Closed Economy (With Government)

- $GDP = C + I + G = Y$

- $$
	S_{national} = S_{private} + S_{public} \\
	= (Y - T + TR - C) + (T - TR - G) \\
	= Y - C - G \\
	= I
	$$

- $S_{national} = I$

### Open Economy (With Government)

- $GDP = C + I + G + NX$
- $S_{national} = S_{dom}^D + S_{for}^D$, $I = S_{dom}^D + S_{dom}^F$
- $S_{national} - I = S_{for}^D - S_{dom}^F = NFI$
- $S_{national} = I + NFI = Y - C - G$
- $NX = NFI$

### Loanable Funds Market

- $S_{national} = I$, for closed economy

- Present value calculation

	- $$
		A = \frac{B}{(1+i)^t}
		$$

- Bond pricing

	- A bond has three things

		- Face value: $A$
		- Coupon: $r$
		- Years of maturity: $n$
		- Yield

	- A bond's yield (determined by the secondary market) has an inverse relationship with its price, e.g. if the yield increases compared to when it was bought, the bond's price decreases.

	- To calculate the current price, given an interest rate of $i$

		- $$
			P = \frac{A}{(1+i)^n} + \frac{r}{(1+i)^n} + \frac{r}{(1+i)^{n-1}} + \frac{r}{(1+i)^{n-2}} + \dots + \frac{r}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{r}{(1+i)}
			$$

- Hypothetical

	- Demand (firms) $\leftrightarrow$ Supply (household/savings)

- Nominal interest rate: opportunity cost; Assumed fixed expected return, higher the interest rate, fewer the projects, less the funds needed $\to$ Downward sloping demand

- Nominal interest rate: determine the return of lending/saving; Higher the interest rate, more lucrative to save $\to$ Upward sloping supply
- Equilibrium Interest Rate occurs when $D = S$
- Shift in Demand
	- $\Delta$ in perceived business profitability and opportunities
	- $\Delta$ in government policies that affect investment decisions (tax credit / subsidy)
- Shift in Supply
	- $\Delta$ in private savings behaviour
	- $\Delta$ in budget balance
- Global market
	- In open economies, flow of funds are driven by
		- Interest differentials
		- Risk status
		- Exchange rate
	- Ceteris paribus, funds flow to market with **higher** interest rate from market with **lower** interest rate
	- The net capital outflow = The net capital inflow
- Change in expected inflation: **Fisher Effect**
	- The equilibrium corresponds to a given expected inflation $\tau_{expected}$
	- A change in expecting inflation would shift demand and supply of loanable funds simultaneously, leading to a new equilibrium rate, but NOT changing equilibrium quantity
	- $r = i - \tau$
	- The real interest rate remains the same

## Chapter 11: Income and Expenditure

### Assumption

- Producers are willing supply additional output at a fixed price
- Fixed interest rate
- No government spending
- Closed economy

### Multiplier Effect

- Multiple rounds of increase in aggregate output will follow the initial change

- Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)

	- Limit leading to a fixed amount increase in aggregate income

	- $$
		MPC = \frac{\Delta spending}{\Delta Y_D}
		$$

	- $Y_D = expenditure + saving$

- Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)

	- $1 - MPC$

- Let the autonomous change to be $\Delta AC$, then

	- $$
		\Delta Y = \frac{1}{1-MPC} \times \Delta AC
		$$

	- The multiplier is $\frac{1}{1-MPC} = \frac{1}{MPS}$

### Aggregate Consumption Function

- Individual consumption spending is driven by household's disposable income $y_d$
	- $C = \sum c_{individual}$
- Individual consumption function
	- $c = \alpha + MPC \times y_d$
	- $c$: a household's consumer spending
	- $\alpha$: autonomous consumer spending
	- $y_d$: disposable income
	- $MPC = \dv{c}{y_d}$
- Aggregating individual consumption function
	- $C = \beta + MPC_{agg} \times Y_D$
	- $\beta = \sum \alpha$
	- $Y_D$: Since there is no government, this is the real GDP
	- $MPC_{agg}$: calculated through $\frac{\Delta c_{total}}{\Delta y_{d:total}}$
- Shifts in aggregate consumption function
	- Changes in expected future disposable income
		- Permanent income hypothesis: Consumers spend at a level consistent with their long-term average income
	- Changes in aggregate wealth
		- Life cycle hypothesis: People seek to maintain roughly the same level of consumption throughout their lifetimes by **taking on debt** or **liquidating assets** early and late in life (when income is low), and saving (when income is high)

### Investment spending

- $I_{planned}$: the investment spending that business plan or intend to undertake during a given period, depends on

	- $i$: interest rate
	- expected real GDP
		- %rGDP $\uparrow$ $\to$ $I_{planned} \uparrow$
	- current level of production capacity

- $I_{unplanned}$: value of change in total inventories due to unexpected swing in sales

	- Inventories: goods held to meet future sales needs
	- Inventory investment: the value of the change in total inventories
	- Positive: unexpected increase in the value of inventory
	- Negative: unexpected decrease in the value of inventory

- $$
	GDP = C + I \\
	Y_D = (\beta + MPC_{agg} \times Y_D) + (I_{planned} + I_{unplanned})
	$$

- $AE_{planned}$: Planned aggregate expenditure depends on the level of real GDP

	- $$
		AE_{planned} = C + I_{planned}
		$$

- Income-Expenditure Equilibrium

	- $GDP = AE_{planned} + I_{unplanned}$

- Consider an Open Economy (Without Government)

	- Assume $M$(import) to be $M = f(Y_D) = mY_d \{0 \le m \le 1\}$
	- $AE_{planned} = Y_D$
		- Ignoring trade for a while: $AE_{planned} = C + I_{planned} = (\beta + MPC_{agg} \times Y_D) = Y = Y_D \to Y = \frac{\beta + I_{planned}}{1-MPC}$
		- Considering only export: $AE_{planned} = C + I_{planned} + X = (\beta + I_{planned} + X) + MPC_{agg} \times Y_D = Y = Y_D \to Y = \frac{\beta + I_{planned} + X}{1 - MPC}$
		- Considering both export and import: $AE_{planned} = C + I_{planned} + NX = (\beta + I_{planned} + X) + (MPC_{agg}-m) \times Y_D = Y = Y_D \to Y = \frac{\beta + I_{planned} + X}{1 - MPC + m}$

## Chapter 12: Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply

### Assumptions

- Price are no long fixed
- Nominal interest rate may vary
- Government purchases goods and collect taxes
- The economy is closed

### Income-Expenditure Model

- e.g. An increase in GDP deflator (higher price level), ceteris paribus, will shift $AE_{planned}$ downwards in parallel
- Prices we are interested in
	- Goods and services
	- Assets: property, stock, bonds
	- Factor of production: wages (labor), rent (land), interest (capital)
- Why does the above example work that way?
	- Wealth effect: asset value $\downarrow$ $\to$ purchasing power $\downarrow$ $\to$ $AE_{planned}$ downward shift
	- Interest rate effect: money holding $\downarrow$ $\to$ savings $\downarrow$ $\to$ interest rate $\uparrow$ $\to$ consumption, investment $\downarrow$ $\to$ $AE_{planned}$ downward shift
	- Outcome: Price index and real GDP are negatively related, ceteris paribus

### Aggregate Demand

- AD curve is not the same as the usual downward sloping demand curve ($Y$(real GDP) is $x$-axis)
- Shift in AD
	- Changes in expectation
	- Changes in wealth: price index remained same, but asset value increased
	- Size of existing stock of physical capital
	-  Fiscal policy
	- Monetary policy
- Shift from fiscal policy
	- Lump-sum tax: $AE_{planned} = (\beta + I_{planned} + G) + MPC_{agg} \times (Y - T)$
	- Proportional tax: $AE_{planned} = (\beta + I_{planned} + G) + MPC_{agg} \times Y \times (1-t)$, if we assume $T = tY,\{0 < t < 1\}$
- Shift from monetary policy
	- Change in interest rate, or money supply
	- e.g. G: money supply $\uparrow$ $\to$ household money $\uparrow$ $\to$ purchase power $\uparrow$ $\to$ savings $\uparrow$ $\to$ loanable funds market (supply right-shift) $\uparrow$ $\to$ interest rate $\downarrow$ $\to$ $I_{planned} \uparrow$ $\to$ $AE_{planned}$ $\uparrow$ $\to$ AD right-shift

### Aggregate Supply

- Shows the relationship between aggregate price index level and quantity of aggregate output producers are willing to supply in the economy

- Short run aggregate supply (SRAS): no change in technology, no change in input price

	- Upward sloping: profit = output price -  input price
	- If output price decreases, to maximize profit, costs are cut (labor $\downarrow$), this raises marginal productivity while decreasing marginal cost, leading to profit per unit rising at new price index, but a decrease in output.
	- Shift in SRAS
		- $\Delta$ commodity price / input price (assuming output price constant), e.g. $\Delta$ nominal wage
		- $\Delta$ productivity
		- $\Delta$ regulation

- Long run aggregate supply (LRAS): change in technology, change in input/output price (adjust to changes in price index)

	- Wages are not sticky in the long-run as contracts are renegotiated, so aggregate price level has no effect on the quantity of aggregate output supplied

	- The long run is the time it takes for all prices (including nominal wages) to adjust

	- LRAS is a vertical line for $Y_{potential}$ (potential output, at full employment)

	- If the economy is at a price and output level away from LRAS (output gap), wages will adjust to shift SRAS toward equilibrium

		- Output gap > 0: inflationary (market overheated)
		- Output gap < 0: recessionary (idle labor present)

	- $$
		\frac{rGDP_{actual} - rGDP_{potential}}{rGDP_{potential}}
		$$

### Demand shock

- An event that causes AD to shift
	- Positive: Expansionary fiscal policy, right shift
	- Negative: Recession abroad can cause left shift of AD through fall in export

### Supply shock

- An event that causes SRAS to shift
	- Positive: Technological improvement increasing profit per unit for a given price level
	- Negative: Oil price increase decreasing profit per unit

### Long run equilibriuim

- The economy is in long run macroeconomic equilibrium if SR equilibrium is on LRAS
- Positive demand shock $\to$ AD right shift $\to$ Higher $P$, higher $Q$ in SR $\to$ SRAS left shift to LRAS (Higher P, same Q) in LR
- Negative demand shock $\to$ AD left shift $\to$ Lower $P$, lower $Q$ in SR $\to$ SRAS right shift to LRAS (Lower P, same Q) in LR

## Chapter 13: Fiscal Policy

### Beyond Direct Purchases

- Change in tax rule $\to$ change in $Y_D$ $\to$ change in $C$
- Transfer payments (pensions, social assistance)
- Influence to change investments
- They all shift AD

### Fiscal Policy

- Keynesian theory
	- Recessionary gap: increase output by $G \uparrow, T \downarrow, TR \uparrow$
	- Inflationary gap: decrease output by $G \downarrow, T \uparrow, TR \downarrow$
		- Usually, when closing an inflationary gap, instead of seeing deflation, we see disinflation
- Criticisms
	- Government spending crowds out private spending
	- Government borrowing crowds out private investment spending
	- Government budget deficit leads to private spending to drop (Ricardian equivalence)

### Multiplier Effect

- Government purchase multiplier

	- $$
		Multiplier = \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta G}
		$$

- Consider a closed economy with proportional tax

	- $GDP = C + I + G = (\beta + MPC_{agg} \times Y_D) + I + G = \beta + MPC_{agg} \times Y \times (1-t) + I + G$
	- So we have a multiplier of $\frac{1}{1-MPC(1-t)}$

- This will shift AD to the right by $\Delta G \times multiplier$

	- However, the new price equilibrium is higher for AD and SRAS
		- Therefore, the ultimate $\Delta Y$ will be less than what it originally shifted

### Tax and Transfer Multiplier

- General transfer payments or tax adjustments will have a smaller effect on AD compared to government's direct purchase
- For the same $\Delta G = \Delta TR$
	- Government multiplier is $\frac{1}{1-MPC(1-t)}$
	- Transfer multiplier is $\frac{MPC(1-t)}{1-MPC(1-t)}$, as the transfer payments will first be saved and taxed before changing the real GDP again in the loop.

### Automatic Stabilizers

- Automatic stabilizers are government programs and budgets that automatically offsets fluctuation in the economy

## Chapter 14: Money, Banking and the Central Banking System

### Quantity of Money and Money's role

- Definition of Money: any asset that facilitates transactions of goods and services
- Money supply = Money in circulation + Chequable deposits
- Money **generates gains from trade** by helping us avoiding **double coincidence of wants** (Item exchanged directly)
- Roles
	- Medium of exchange
	- Store of value
	- Unit of account
- Types
	- Commodity money (gold)
	- Commodity-backed money (US dollar before 1971)
	- Fiat money (central bank's credit and government's declaration)

### Measuring Money Supply

- M1+
	- currency in circulation + personal and business chequable deposits (in chartered banks, trust, mortgage and loan companies, credit union & caisses populaires)
- M2
	- Currency in circulation + personal and business deposits in **chartered banks only** (chequable and non-chequable such as savings account and term deposits) - interbank deposits
- M2+
	- M2 + personal and business deposits in other institutions + life insurance company individual annuities + money market mutual funds

### Banks

- Liquid asset (money deposited) $\to$ Banks (financial intermediary) $\to$ Illiquid assets

- Bank Reserve = Cash in vaults + deposit kept in central bank under its account

	- This is to meet withdrawal requirement by its depositors

- If we assume a fixed portion of total deposit is set for bank reserve, then (With T-account model)

	- |  Assets  | Liabilities |
		| :------: | :---------: |
		| Reserves |  Deposits   |
		|  Loans   |   Equity    |

	- If we denote the reserve ratio to be $rr$, and a change in deposit to be $\Delta d$

		- We eventually would increase chequable deposits by $\frac{\Delta d}{rr}$

- In reality, loans that are made to people will be deposited and held as cash (leakage). This leakage will reduce the **money multiplier** 

- Given the amount of **money supply** and **monetary base**

	- Money supply = currency in circulation + chequable deposits

	- Monetary base = currency in circulation + bank reserve

	- $$
		Multiplier = \frac{Money-supply}{Monetary-base}
		$$

### Central Bank's Tool of Monetary Control

- Reserve requirement (reserve ratio)
- Bank rate (discount rate)
	- Open market operations
- Deposit switching

## Chapter 15: Monetary Policy

### Money and interest rate

- The **liquidity preference model** of the interest rate asserts that $i$ is determined by the supply and demand for money
- $i = i(M)$, where $M$ refers to the quantity of money
- If the central bank chooses the level of money supply, then money supply is a vertical line

### Liquidity Preference Model

- $i_E$ is the equilibrium interest rate
	- If $i > i_E$, there is excess cash, then cash would be used to buy bonds/GIC etc.
		- Buying bonds/GIC, leads to demand $\uparrow$
		- For bond issuers, they will be issuing bonds at $i \downarrow$
	- If $i < i_E$, there is shortage of cash, then people would want to hold on to cash by selling off assets
