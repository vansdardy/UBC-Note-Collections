I love and hate this course. Taught by 4 or 5 professors at once, each professor handling a different part of the course. The course included six major topics: Bootstrapping Techniques, Random(ized) Search Tree, Point Location, Linear Programming, Randomized Algebraic Algorithms, and Parallel Algorithms. I love this course because this is the furthest I have reached in theoretical computer science, and I hate this course because this course is actually extremely hard for me. This course made me feel that my first two years at UBC were a waste, and I still think that when I occasionally look through the in-class note of this course. This is going to probably take me a while to figure things out.
