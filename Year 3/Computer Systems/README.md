This course is taught jointly by Prof. Timothy Roscoe and Prof. Thomas Locher. Prof. Roscoe taught the Operating System half of the course, while Prof. Locher taught the Distributed System half of the course. You will notice that even my in-class note is incomplete, and this is because the second half of the course (Distributed System) is asynchronous mode, and I skipped almost all of this half because I was struggling with mainly my mental state. The added fuel of Compiler Design's project to the fire of my badly-shaped mentality did not help at all. This is going to be something I need to re-learn completely.
