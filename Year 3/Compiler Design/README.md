This course actually inspired me to dig deeper about compilers, because I never thought the compilers could be so fascinating to begin with. This course was taught by Prof. Zhendong Su. It was quite an interesting course, but definitely difficult to push through. Especially the project using OCaml, tortured me, could not have made it through if it weren't for another classmate to help me.
